# TypeScript Crash Course

This tutorial assumes familiarity with basic JavaScript concepts. It does not explain the basics of JavaScript; it will instead go over TypeScript-specific features and concepts.

## Benefits of TypeScript

- **Extra Compilation Step Added**: TypeScript provides a wrapper layer of compilation; hence, this allows the developer to catch the bugs in an early stage of development, helping you write more robust and maintainable code.
- **Strong and Static Typing**: TypeScript enforces strong typing. It allows for better predictability of code and helps developers avoid runtime errors. The types in TypeScript are checked at compile-time, which enhances the reliability of the code.

- **Type Definitions for Popular JavaScript Libraries**: TypeScript has type definitions for a large number of popular JavaScript libraries. This allows the use of features in an IDE such as autocompletion, type checking, and refactoring support.

- **Encapsulation**: This enables TypeScript to support object-oriented programming, where data and methods can be encapsulated within a common class or module for better organization and reuse of code.

- **Private / Public Member Variable Decorators**: These are supported in TypeScript to define access modifiers like private and public for class member variables, structuring your code better and making it more secure. **Better Tooling**: Integration with modern IDEs and text editors provides TypeScript with rich developer tools such as code navigation, refactoring, and inline documentation that make development easier and speedier.
