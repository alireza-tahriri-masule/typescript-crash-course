/**
 * This TypeScript example demonstrates the Singleton design pattern,
 * ensuring only one instance of a class is created and shared across the application.
 *
 * - `Singleton` Class: Restricts instantiation to a single instance.
 * - `private constructor`: Prevents direct instantiation from outside the class.
 * - `static getInstance()`: Returns the existing instance or creates one if it doesnâ€™t exist.

   * Holds the single instance of the class.
   * Marked as `private static` to ensure restricted access.

  /**
   * Provides access to the single instance of the class.

// Testing the Singleton behavior
const instanceA = Singleton.getInstance();
const instanceB = Singleton.getInstance();
